# Terraform Infrastructure Documentation

This document explains the Terraform configuration for the ScamShield project.

## Overview

We use Terraform to manage our AWS infrastructure. The configuration is organized as follows:

- `modules/`: Reusable infrastructure components
  - `network/`: VPC, subnets, internet gateway, etc.
  - `database/`: Database resources (to be implemented)
  - `compute/`: Compute resources (to be implemented)
  - `storage/`: Storage resources (to be implemented)
  - `monitoring/`: Monitoring resources (to be implemented)

- `environments/`: Environment-specific configurations
  - `dev/`: Development environment
  - `staging/`: Staging environment (to be implemented)
  - `production/`: Production environment (to be implemented)

## Network Infrastructure

The network module creates:

- A Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) with a CIDR block of 10.0.0.0/16
- Public subnets in two availability zones (10.0.1.0/24, 10.0.2.0/24)
- Private subnets in two availability zones (10.0.3.0/24, 10.0.4.0/24)
- An Internet Gateway for the VPC
- Route tables for public and private subnets

## Next Steps

1. Configure S3 backend for Terraform state
2. Implement database module (RDS, DynamoDB)
3. Implement compute module (ECS/EKS)
4. Implement storage module (S3)
5. Implement monitoring module (CloudWatch)
